# Serverless Image URL Scraper

This is a lightweight api deployed to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) which leverages the [HTMLRewriter runtime API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter) to quickly scrape image URLs from a webpage. A huge inspiration for this was [Adam Schwartz's workers web-scraper](https://workers.cloudflare.com/built-with/projects/web-scraper)
